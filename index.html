        Well today was my first day of senior year. It’s so weird to think that
        I made it this far. I’m so excited for my Computer Programming class.
        <span class="green"
          >It seems like there’s a lot of interesting things ahead.</span

      <h1>August 19, 2021</h1>
      <p>
        We did the get to know you game in Computer Programming. That was fun.
        That girl sitting next to me is kinda cute. Cool video on Computer
        Science. I might have to look into that.
        <span class="green">Excited to start typing code.</span>
      </p>
      <h1>August 23, 2021</h1>
      <p>
        In Computer Programming, we finally started typing code! It is so cool.
        <span class="green">I love it!</span>
      </p>
      <h1>August 24, 2021</h1>
      <p>
        <span class="red">Computer Programming seems so daunting.</span> So much
        to learn with Python.
      </p>
      <h1>August 27, 2021</h1>
      <p>
        Went to Comp Prog. I learned how to make a calculator. There were some
        problems but it was all good. Learned about the jobs that are out there
        in programming. It’s so interesting.
        <span class="green">This might be in my future.</span>
      </p>
      <h1>August 29, 2021</h1>
      <p>I feel like my Comp Prog class is moving too slow.</p>
      <h1>Septemeber 6, 2021</h1>
      <p>
        Worked on the Escape Room Project. I pretty much finished it except for
        a couple of things that I want to talk to Mr. Blair about. I also want
        to have a project to work on with programming.
        <span class="green">It’s really interesting and I really like it.</span>
        I showed Graham the Escape Room. And I think he liked it. It’s not the
        most user friendly but that's because it doesn't have visuals.
      </p>
      <h1>Septemeber 27, 2021</h1>
      <p>
        Went to Comp Prog. Tried to start working on the Pumpkin Project, but
        didn’t get very far.
      </p>
      <h1>Septemeber 28, 2021</h1>
      <p>Worked on the Pumpkin Project in Audio Production.</p>
      <h1>October 1, 2021</h1>
      <p>
        Worked on Pumpkin most of the time. Didn’t get it quite working. Went
        home after school and worked on Pumpkin. Got it working, turned it in,
        then took a nap.
      </p>
      <h1>October 7, 2021</h1>
      <p>
        In Comp Prog, we learned a lot more in Python Turtle Graphics. It's
        basically a tiny little turtle on the screen that you can draw pictures
        and designs with. Practiced with that.
        <span class="green"
          >It's so fun to just watch the little guy move around the
          screen.</span
        >
      </p>
      <h1>November 1, 2021</h1>
      <p>
        Today in Computer Programming, we learned about functions and global
        variables. Functions are going to really open up my world of things I
        can do.
      </p>
      <h1>November 30, 2021</h1>
      <p>
        We started on the Visual Escape Room today. I think I'm going to go for
        a pixelly stick figure look. Partly becasue it'll look cool, but mostly
        because it's a lot easier to design.
      </p>
      <h1>January 7, 2022</h1>
      <p>
        We learned about CSV's(Comma Seperated Values) today.
        <span class="green">I feel like everyday I learn something big.</span>
        Even the small things seem big.
      </p>
      <h1>January 21, 2022</h1>
      <p>
        <span class="green">I kinda popped off today.</span> We learned about
        sets and dictionaries and I basically finished our next project in the
        same sitting.
      </p>
      <h1>February 15, 2022</h1>
      <p>
        Today was definitely the funniest day in Computer Programming. Mr. Blair
        was gone so Mr. Ruchti was subbing. Mr. Ruchti gave us some words of
        knowledge. "My momma always told me to put things back exactly where I
        found them." Then Cameron Teasdale gave us some of his knowledge. "My
        momma told me to never commit arson. Did I listen to her? No." I didn't
        quite know what to think of that.
        <span class="green"
          >I guess programmers are just a different breed.</span
        >
      </p>
      <h1>March 18, 2022</h1>
      <p>
        We started the Whack-A-Mole project today. I brainstormed some ideas and
        I thought I got a pretty good idea of how to do it, but then I started
        coding. <span class="red">Everything was going wrong.</span> I was
        really confused.
      </p>
      <h1>April 14, 2022</h1>
      <p>
        I'm still working on the Whack-A-Mole game and I'm still not getting it.
        It's been almost a month and I still can't get it.
        <span class="red"
          >I'm scared I'm not good enough to make computer programming a
          career.</span
        >
      </p>
      <h1>April 26, 2022</h1>
      <p>
        After 12 days of
        <span class="red">fustration, failure, and almost giving up</span>, I
        finally got the Whack-A-Mole game working! There's nothing like the
        moment when you type that last line of code, hit "Run" and
        <span class="green"
          >then watch as the program beautifully comes into shape.</span
        >
        Now all I have to do is clean up the animation which shouldn't be too
        bad.
      </p>
      <h1>May 10, 2022</h1>
      <p>
        Well I'm done with everything in the class, but there's still so much to
        learn. I still don't know if I'll be able to make this a carreer.
        <span class="red">I still have some doubts</span>, but everytime I
        finish a program,
        <span class="green">some of those doubts disappear.</span> This class
        has taught me so much about computer programming, but more importantly
        <span class="green">it introduced me to something I now love.</span>
